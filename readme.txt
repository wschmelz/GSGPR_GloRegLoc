This tool is a generalized algorithm for the evaluation of spatial variation using gaussian processes within the temporal domain. 

Download and run GSGPR_tidegauges.py as a standalone file. Instructions for the use of this tool can be found in that file, GSGPR_tidegauges.py. Methods are based off a Bayesian hierarchical model from Schmelz et al. (2021; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090521). GP regression algorithm is from Rasmussen and Williams (2006; http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf). Tide gauge data is from the PSMSL database (Holgate et al., 2013; 
https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00175.1).
