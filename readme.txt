This tool is a generalized algorithm for the evaluation of spatial variation using a temporally based hierarchical statistical model that places gaussian process priors on global, regional, and local processes captured by a combination of global and local observations. The model is a gaussian process model fit using maximum liklihood estimation and represents an empirical Bayesian analysis, as defined by Ashe et al. (2019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.10.032).

To run this model, download and run ~/GSGPR_tidegauges.py (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wschmelz/GSGPR_GloRegLoc/main/GSGPR_tidegauges.py) as a standalone file on a local disk. Running this tool will dowload a sample dataset of tide gauge records from the northestern US (from ~/Data/) and apply the model that is contained within ~/Scripts/GSGPR_GloRegLoc.py (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wschmelz/GSGPR_GloRegLoc/main/Scripts/GSGPR_GloRegLoc.py). Instructions for the general use of the tool, and information about methods applied in ~/Scripts/GSGPR_GloRegLoc.py, can be found in the ~/GSGPR_tidegauges.py file. Methods are based off a Bayesian hierarchical model from Schmelz et al. (2021; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090521). The GP regression algorithm is adapted from Rasmussen and Williams (2006; http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf). Tide gauge data (local sample observations) are from the PSMSL database (Holgate et al., 2013; https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00175.1), and GMSL data (global sample observations) are from Church and White (2011; doi:10.1007/s10712-011-9119-1).

This code has been tested to work with Anaconda distribution of Python 3.9 (https://www.anaconda.com/).
