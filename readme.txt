This tool is a generalized algorithm for the application of psuedo-spatial GP regression. 

Download and run GSGPR_tidegauges.py as a standalone file. Instructions for the use of this tool can be found in that file, GSGPR_tidegauges.py. Methods are based off a Bayesian hierarchical model from Schmelz et al. (2021; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090521). GP regression algorithm is from Rasmussen and Williams (2006; http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf).
